# Build Your Product
## A 15-Day Product Building Challenge

**Proposal for Tech Club Initiative**

---

## Executive Summary

**Build Your Product** is a 15-day challenge designed to help students move beyond tutorials and ship real products. With the rise of AI coding assistants, the barrier to building has shifted from technical skills to problem-finding and user validation. This challenge embraces that shift.

| Parameter | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Duration | 15 Days |
| Format | 14 days building + 1 day presenting |
| Start Date | February 16, 2025 |
| Philosophy | Ship over tech stack. Use AI freely. Focus on users. |

---

## The Problem

Students today face a paradox:
- More tools than ever — AI, no-code, cloud platforms
- Less shipping than ever — Tutorial hell, analysis paralysis
- Outdated focus — Obsessing over languages instead of users

Traditional hackathons reinforce this:
- 24-48 hours (too short to validate)
- Focus on tech, not users
- No iteration cycle
- Products die after demo

---

## The Solution

A 15-day challenge that mirrors real product development:

```
Week 1: Find problem → Build MVP → Get first users
Week 2: Iterate → Scale to 100 users → Launch publicly
Day 15: Present to community
```

### Key Differentiators

| Traditional Hackathon | Build Your Product |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| 24-48 hours | 15 days |
| Build for judges | Build for real users |
| Tech-focused | Problem-focused |
| Demo day | Production launch |
| Solo/assigned teams | Your team, your idea |
| One weekend | Two weeks to iterate |
